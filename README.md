# Water-temperatures-analysis-R
A structured and problematized analysis of the water temperatures of the Touques.

The "script.R" file contains the code. It is a script that loads the data into R and organizes it for analysis.
We've analyzed our data using first : Descriptive statistics (e.g  mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient...)
We've afterwards ran an ICA, and finally a PCA on the independent components from the ICA.
The script can be opened in RStudio and run line by line to observe the different plots and the changes in the data sets. 

The "Rapport Analyse de donn√©es.pdf" document is our report on the problematic. It contains a detailed study with diagrams and graphics and their interpretation.
