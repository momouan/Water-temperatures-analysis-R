# Water-temperatures-analysis-R
A structured and problematized analysis of the water temperatures of the Touques.

The "script.R" file contains the code. It is a script that loads the data into R and organizes it for analysis. <br>
We've analyzed our data using first : Descriptive statistics (e.g  mean, standard deviation, correlation...) <br>
We've afterwards ran an ICA to separate own n main signals, and finally did a PCA on the independent components from the ICA. <br>
The script can be opened in RStudio and run line by line to observe the different plots and the changes in the data sets. <br>

The "Rapport Analyse de donn√©es.pdf" document is our report discussing our different results. It contains a detailed study with diagrams and graphics and their interpretation.
