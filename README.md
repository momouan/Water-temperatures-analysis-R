# Water-temperatures-analysis-R
A structured and problematized analysis of the water temperatures of the Touques.

The "script.R" file contains the code. It is a script that loads the data into R and organizes it for analysis.
We've analyzed our data using first : Descriptive statistics (e.g  mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient...)
We afterwards ran an ICA, then a PCA on the independent components from the ICA.

The "Rapport Analyse de donn√©es.pdf" document is our report on the problematic. It contains a detailed study with diagrams and graphics and their interpretation.
